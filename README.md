# ANLY 550 Structs & Algs for Analytics

This course covers algorithmic techniques for solving different types of data science problems. It covers Big O notation, data structures (arrays, stacks, queues, lists, trees, heaps, graphs), sorting and searching (binary search trees, hash tables), and algorithmic paradigms for efficient problem solving (divide and conquer, recursion, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, etc.). It includes both theory and practice. You will learn to design, analyze, and implement fundamental data structures and algorithms. This course will provide the algorithmic background essential for further study of computer science topics.
