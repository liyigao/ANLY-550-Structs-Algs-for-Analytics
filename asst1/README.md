# Homework 1 - Computing the Fibonacci numbers & Merge Sort

In Python, implement the three different methods (recursive, iterative, and matrix) for computing the Fibonacci numbers. Call these programs `recursive.py`, `iterative.py`, and `matrix.py` respectively.

Make sure to compute the numbers exactly (no floating point arithmetic). How far does each process get after one minute of machine time?

To help ascertain how much of the runtime is due to the complexity of multiplying large integers, modify your programs so that they return the Fibonacci numbers modulo 65536 = 216. (In other words, make all of your arithmetic modulo 216).

Implement Merge Sort in Python and turn in your source code. Call the program `mergesort.py`. The implementation should read a comma-separated list of numbers from `stdin`, sort the list, and print out the result. You may assume the length of the list is a power of two.
